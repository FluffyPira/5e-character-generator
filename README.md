# Simple 5e Math Handler v 0.01
This is a simple ruby script I made for my upcoming 5e campaign to handle the math for some of the other players. Really simple, just run the script and follow it through to completion. It should hopefully shoot out most of the math calculations needed when starting a new character. The skills you basically still have to do on your own!
