# Simple 5e Character Generator v 0.02
This is a simple ruby script I made for my upcoming 5e campaign to handle the math for some of the other players. Really simple, just run the script and follow it through to completion. It should hopefully shoot out most of the math calculations needed when starting a new character as well as some of the features/traits.

Still very much a work in progress though and does not incorporate any of the player generated content for 5th Edition. If you have homebrew content you wish to add, fork it, fix it, and pull request it. If that's not your thing, shoot me an email at pira@fluffypira.sexy and I'll see if I can update it.
