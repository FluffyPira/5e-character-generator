Since you were a young teenager you've been working in streets and brothels as a prostitute. How did you become a prostitute? Were your parents forced to sell you into the trade to pay their own debts or did you feely choose the life? Did you work primarily out of a brothel or primarily on the streets? Were you in the employ of the citenizens or the military? Do you look to seek redemption for your previous work or is it simply another facet of your character you wish to explore more deeply?

Primary work (Roll a D6)
1 I worked primarily out of a brothel.
2 I followed around a trading caravan.
3 I worked primarily on the streets.
4 I was in the employ for a noble as their personal escort.
5 I was in the employ of the army and toured local military outposts.
6 I was sold into sex slavery.

Feature: Good waffles stick together
The local sex trade is often a tightly knit community that watches eachothers backs. Because of this it is easier to receive information from any other prostitutes that share a similar line of work (gender, sexual orientation, fetish). Furthermore, brothels will likely aid you and your party as well as provide access to information, shelter, and even work should you so choose.

Alternative Feature: I work alone
Whether because your work precluded it, you never felt welcome, or you simply had no interest in it, you've never quite fallen in with other sex workers. In spite of the this however, your charm and skills are slightly stronger. Every time you would roll a persuasion, deception, or athletics check, you gain advantage.
